# Segment Anything Model

Discover the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a powerful image segmentation tool, and its seamless integration with RobotFlow and YOLO to elevate image annotation. Delve into how straightforward fine-tuning of SAM can significantly improve medical imaging analyses, such as lung CT scans, and explore its broader implications in public health strategies, like streamlining COVID-19 vaccine delivery. The talk will be provided by Xi Wang.
